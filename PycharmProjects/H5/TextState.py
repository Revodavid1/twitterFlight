######## Use Case 2: User registers observers #######
    # User typed in “register observers” into Controller.py.



    # This will cause all 3 observers of the TextState class to register
    # for notifications of the TextState object.



    # Each observer will print out that it is waiting for
    # TextState notifications.



    # When registered in this way, all counts inside the
    # observers will be reset to their
    # starting values.
